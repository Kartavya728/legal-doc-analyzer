    prompt = f"""
    You are an expert legal document classifier with deep knowledge of Indian and international legal systems.  

    üéØ TASK: Classify this document into ONE category from the list below.  

    üìÇ CATEGORIES:  
    1. Contracts & Agreements  
    2. Litigation & Court Documents  
    3. Regulatory & Compliance  
    4. Corporate Governance Documents  
    5. Property & Real Estate  
    6. Government & Administrative  
    7. Personal Legal Documents  
    8. NON-LEGAL DOCUMENT  
    9. PSEUDO-LEGAL DOCUMENT  

    üîç CLASSIFICATION RULES (STRICT FILTERING):  

    ### STEP 1 - VALIDITY CHECK (Most Important)  
    Decide FIRST if the text is a real legal document or not:  

    *NON-LEGAL DOCUMENT ‚Üí*  
    - Narrative / Fiction: novels, stories, diaries, letters describing events.  
    - Informational / Educational: blog posts, news, academic articles, lecture notes, study guides.  
    - Technical / Business: software code, marketing content, product descriptions, financial reports.  
    - Random / Gibberish: incoherent, fragmented, or irrelevant content.  
    - Legal Commentary: summaries, explanations, or discussions about law but not actual binding documents.  

    *PSEUDO-LEGAL DOCUMENT ‚Üí*  
    - Fake or template-like with placeholders ([INSERT NAME], XXXX, <party A>).  
    - Documents explicitly marked as "Sample", "Template", "Example".  
    - Clearly fabricated or incomplete drafts that cannot be binding.  

    ‚ö† If either case applies, STOP and return only *NON-LEGAL DOCUMENT* or *PSEUDO-LEGAL DOCUMENT* .

    ---

    ### STEP 2 - LEGAL DOCUMENT CLASSIFICATION  
    (Only if it passes Step 1 as a real legal document)  

    Apply priority order:  
    1. *Property & Real Estate* ‚Üí deeds, leases, sale agreements, mortgage docs.  
    2. *Personal Legal Documents* ‚Üí ID cards, wills, birth/marriage certificates, affidavits.  
    3. *Government & Administrative* ‚Üí official notices, government orders, public gazettes.  
    4. *Regulatory & Compliance* ‚Üí licenses, permits, compliance filings, environmental/industry approvals.  
    5. *Corporate Governance Documents* ‚Üí board resolutions, shareholder agreements, bylaws, MOA/AOA.  
    6. *Litigation & Court Documents* ‚Üí petitions, judgments, court orders, arbitration filings.  
    7. *Contracts & Agreements* ‚Üí commercial contracts not covered above (service agreements, NDAs, MoUs).  

    ---

    üéØ DECISION PRIORITY ORDER:  
    1. First filter: NON-LEGAL DOCUMENT vs PSEUDO-LEGAL DOCUMENT.  
    2. If neither, apply Step 2 and assign the most specific category by the rules above.  

    Document Text: {chunk_text}  

    INSTRUCTIONS:  
    - Analyze the *purpose and function*, not just keywords.  
    - Be strict: if it only talks about law but is not a binding legal document, classify as *NON-LEGAL DOCUMENT*.  
    - Return ONLY the category name, nothing else.
