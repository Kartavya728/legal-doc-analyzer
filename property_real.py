    - Create a **clear explanation in simple English** of the entire document, as if explaining to someone with no legal background.

    2. Explain the property being dealt with (from PropertyDetails).  
    3. Explain the money terms — how much, when, who pays what (from FinancialTerms).  
    4. Explain deadlines — possession date, payment dates, lease period, termination conditions (from Deadlines).  
    5. Explain any responsibilities, conditions, or penalties (from OtherNotes).  
    6. End with an overall explanation of what the contract means.
