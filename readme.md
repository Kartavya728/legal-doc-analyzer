# 🚀 GenAI Model Backend

This branch contains the **backend of the GenAI model**, serving as the foundation for the pipeline and integration with the overall system.

The primary goal of this branch was to **streamline the pipeline creation process**. All parts of the GenAI model were:

* Developed **modularly** and uploaded step by step.
* Carefully integrated into a **unified pipeline**.
* Structured in such a way that future **integration into the website and other project components** is smooth and seamless.

This phase of development was crucial in ensuring that the backend was robust, scalable, and flexible enough to support the evolving needs of the project.

## 🔧 Key Highlights

* ✅ **Modular Construction** – Each component of the model was developed and tested independently.
* ✅ **Pipeline-Oriented** – The flow of data and processes was designed to make pipeline creation intuitive and efficient.
* ✅ **Scalability in Mind** – Backend structured to handle future integration with web services and other tools.
* ✅ **Collaborative Development** – Contributions were managed systematically, ensuring clean integration at every step.
